### Example

In this example I'd like to draw a time series. The objective is to
know the problems related to convert axis values with dates to points
in the canvas.

#### Data

I'm using data coming from https://earthquake.usgs.gov

#### Goals

- [ ] The graph will show the severity of every eartquake
- [ ] Every earthquake point will show a tooltip showing the related
  information
- [ ] The graph should show both x and y axis
- [ ] The graph should show x ticks
- [ ] The graph should show y ticks

### Example

In this example I'd like to draw a time series. The objective is to
know the problems related to convert axis values with dates to points
in the canvas.

#### Data

Data has dates as x values.

#### Goals

- [ ] The graph will show x axis with every point interleave of a second
- [ ] Every point will show a tooltip showing the related information
- [ ] The graph should show both x and y axis
- [ ] The graph should show x ticks
- [ ] The graph should show y ticks
